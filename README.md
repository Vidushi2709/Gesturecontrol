Overview
This project demonstrates real-time gesture recognition using computer vision techniques with OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries. The goal is to interpret hand gestures captured through a webcam and perform actions based on recognized gestures, including volume control for the device using PyCaw.

Features
Real-time Gesture Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and recognize hand gestures from live video feed.
Volume Control: Adjusts the system volume based on recognized gestures using the PyCaw library.
User Interface: Displays live webcam feed with overlaid gesture recognition results.

Technologies Used
OpenCV: Used for capturing video frames from the webcam and processing them for gesture recognition.
MediaPipe: Provides hand tracking and gesture recognition models that simplify the implementation of computer vision algorithms.
PyCaw: Python library to control and manipulate audio using the Windows Core Audio API (WASAPI).
Python: Programming language used for the project implementation.
